DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r1 input miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r2 input miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r2 input miz_hdmi_0/inst/my_colour_space_conversion/mult_r2/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>
